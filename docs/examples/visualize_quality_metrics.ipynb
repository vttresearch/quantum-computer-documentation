    "# Visualizing Quality Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum computers performance can change on a regular basis. This can be mitigated to some extent by calibration of the device which generates a _calibration set_, which is a set of parameters to current operate the quantum computer at. Because of drifts in the environment that the quantum computer operates at, regular calibration is required to account for these drifts and maintain optimal performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test the current performance of the calibration, we also benchmark the device, producing a _quality metrics set_. These benchmarks reflect the current status of the quantum computer and are essential pieces of information for using the system. For example, performance can often be increased by choosing a particular qubit or tunable coupler when running your quantum circuit. \n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how one can read the quality metrics set from the API and visualize it. "
