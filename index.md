# Welcome to the VTT Q5 documentation

This website contains the technical documentation about VTT's Quantum Computers and how to access them. Currently we provide access to VTT Q5, a 5 qubit superconducting quantum computer, also named "Helmi". Access to Helmi is currently provided through the [EuroHPC Supercomputer LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/lumi_supercomputer/), operated by [CSC](https://www.csc.fi/).

- Companies can get access to Helmi [here](https://www.vttresearch.com/en/ourservices/quantum-computing).
- Academic researchers can get access to Helmi by following the instructions [here](https://fiqci.fi/_posts/2022-11-01-Helmi-pilot/).

Once a [My CSC](https://my.csc.fi/login) project has been created for you, the next steps can be found on the [Accessing LUMI](lumi.md) page.
